- 👋 Hi, I’m @mahiuddinalkamal
- 👀 I’m interested in Confidential Computing, Trusted Execution Environments as well as cloud-native distributed systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to build confidential softwares from scratch and port existing legacy softwares to enable confidential computing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open-source framework or SDK which will enable applications to make use of confidential computing.
